Welcome to the Notes Website! 

This project allows you to take, edit, delete, and create new notes directly in your web browser. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing your notes effectively. You can easily add new notes, edit existing ones, and delete notes you no longer need. The notes are stored locally using browser storage, ensuring that your data is saved between sessions without requiring any server-side setup.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in front-end web development, focusing on creating a functional and user-friendly application. By leveraging HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive features such as adding, editing, and deleting notes dynamically, I've created a seamless experience for note-taking and management. Whether you're organizing your thoughts, jotting down ideas, or keeping track of tasks, this Notes Website provides a convenient solution for your note-taking needs.
